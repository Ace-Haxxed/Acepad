This is my Numpad/Macropad project for Hackpad. This was made so that I can have a number pad since I upgraded my keyboard to a smaller one and I am missing the full numpad size. It features a rotary encoder, 15 switches, and status LEDs.

This was prgrammed in KMK using POG. POG is a great gui for programming in kmk as you dont ahve to worry about the file organization or compilation. It does it all for you (assuming you are using an rp2040 based MCU) KMK has most of the functionality as QMK, but with POG I found it the easiest option.

Fabrication files are in PCB Fab and 3D models. The assembly stl and step should not be printed. PCB fabrication was made using JLC plugin in KiCad
