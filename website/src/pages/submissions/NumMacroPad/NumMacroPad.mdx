# NumMacroPad
This is my Numpad/Macropad project for Hackpad. This was made so that I can have a number pad since I upgraded my keyboard to a smaller one and I am missing the full numpad size. It features a rotary encoder, 15 switches, and status LEDs.

## PCB
The PCB was probably the most time consuming part. I followed Joe Scottos tutorials on Youtube as a baseline, but overall the design is 100% mine. The PCB was designed in KiCad and used the trace rounding/fillet feature to give it that nice look. I also made a faux "ground plane" so the traces really stand out.

## Design
The case was designed using onshape ([file here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9bd2fe8a66b630f7849ad79b/w/b976060d2e7b414287d23070/e/58c7f637e0987dc33dad021f?renderMode=0&uiState=6788508f46be634465965f4d)) and the shown version is actually the second iteration. The first used a plate made from acrylic but after some mishappenings with that I redesigned it to use clear PETG. I opted for a plateless design for the second iteration so that I wouldnt have to desolder and resolder on all the switches each time if I wanted to make a change or take off the plate. With the plateless design, I use a ledge built in to the body to hold the pcb up. I gave that ledge just enough tolerance so i caould use electrical tape around the edges to fill in the gaps and dampen the sound when you press down on the key (it sounds super nice). The petg top and bottom helps diffuse the leds and provides that nice underglow on the bottom.

## Firmware
This was prgrammed in KMK using POG. POG is a great gui for programming in kmk as you dont ahve to worry about the file organization or compilation. It does it all for you (assuming you are using an rp2040 based MCU) KMK has most of the functionality as QMK, but with POG I found it the easiest option.
