# Artpad

Artpad is a 8 key macropad designed by @Person20020 that is designed for the [Artsey](https://artsey.io/) keyboard layout. 
It has exposed diodes (which I like the look of) and an exposed controller for easy access for flashing. 
It also has a breakout for all pins on the side so that you can add more keys, rotary encoders, a joystick, or even a screen.

# Features:
- 8 keys arranged for the Artsey layout (I use it with a (Colemak variation)[https://keymapdb.com/keymaps/purple_rw/])
- Exposed diodes and controller
- Breakout for all pins for expansion modules
- QMK firmware with vial support

# CAD Model
Everything Is assembled with 4 M3 Bolts and heatset inserts. The case is 3D printed in 3 parts. The top, the bottom, and the plate are assembled in a sandwich style that makes supports unnecessary. 
The case is currently designed for the controller to be surface mounted which keeps the whole thing thinner.

# PCB
This is my PCB! It was made in KiCad and was my first experience with designing a PCB. I would say it went pretty well and there were no issues with it when it arrived.
