# Frequently Asked Questions

**When is the deadline?** \
February 16th, 2025. This is the deadline for the macropad. The deadline for the keyboard is March 16th, 2025.

**What's new with v2?** \
Lots of stuff! Updated list of requirements, more content, and other goodies - the big thing is that after making a macropad, you can design and submit an entire ***keyboard*** to be made!

**Do *I* have to make a macropad before making a keyboard?** \
Absolutely! A keyboard is *significantly* harder to design, and so its a prerequisite you understand the fundamentals with a macropad first

**Will my hackpad come assembled?** \
Unfortunately not! Not to fear though - we'll send you a soldering iron, straight from HQ if you don't have one already.

**Can I use acrylic/cnc metal/etc for the case/plate?** \
NO!!! Only 3D prints are supported for the macropad. Keyboards don't have this limit though!

**Where are the parts shipped from?** \
Vermont, USA!

**Can I use parts outside of the approved list?** \
You can, but you'll most likely have to source it yourself. You may request a grant from HQ to get them, and we'll approve it on a case-by-case basis. Not guaranteed.

**What colours are the keycaps?** \
We have red, black, and white keycaps at HQ. You can request what color specifically, but it's not guaranteed it'll be fulfilled. Sorry!
