# pizzaPad
Hey, I'm pizzalover125. I made the pizzaPad, a basic macropad that can be used for anything! I used Easy
EDA for the PCB, Onshape for the CAD, and QMK for the firmware. The project took roughly 20 hours, mostly 
spent troubleshooting CAD software (Fusion mostly). I'm usually designing software, so learning this
intricate hardware was amazing.

PS: The macropad has nothing to do with pizza, unfortunaetly.
