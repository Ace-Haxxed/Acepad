## Inspirations + Purpose
Hello! I just want to preface this by saying thank you for taking the time to look at my submission! This will be my very first official pull request for anything in the YSWS project series and it is quite exciting :) I learned about this particular project just this afternoon and have tried my hardest to work on it. To add on, this is also my first macro pad, and the fact that I was able to build it myself with the lovely tutorials and possibilities of customization is still surreal. While I’ve done PCB design in the past creating the case and learning about the firmware was quite the experience. My design is a bit on the simple side but I plan on making it used for a variety of purposes and experimenting with its capabilities. I also cannot wait to dive into the keyboard V2 and hopefully get a bit more creative with it. The inspiration for this hack pad was honestly simplicity, but I wanted to be curves so it matched my computer’s edges, plus this handle may be my newest GitHub account/tech account, so I thought I would try to make it official. 

Also, my firmware is the starter, but I hope to make it more complicated and tinker around with it once I receive my macro pad (hopefully!) as from what I understood it is editable even after production.
