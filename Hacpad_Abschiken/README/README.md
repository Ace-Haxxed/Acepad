	+12 normal switches (switch matrix)
	+12 LED's under the switches 
	+an Oled-Display
	+XIAO-RP2040-DIP
	+IQ-Expander
   !everything possible in plack please!

IMPORTANT:
	+every possible in black (for example the case or the switches)
	+code isn't completely ready yet, but with my Hackpad I will fix it
