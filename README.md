BOM: 
1 Seeed XIAO RP2040 
6 MX 1.00u keyswitches 
6 DO-35 diodes 6 DSA keycaps (preferably light blue but white is fine if that's not an option) 
1 PCB 
1 Case bottom (3dp with black filament) 
1 Case top (3dp with black filament) 
1 Plate (laser cut out of acrylic, preferably light blue, but white is fine if that's not an option)

The hardest challenge I faced was coding the firmware, I had trouble installing and setting up qmk and ran out of time because it wouldn't compile and I didn't know how to fix the error ðŸ˜­ (I've inlcuded the keymap.c and info.json files under firmware). Overall I learned a lot from this project, I had no idea how to use kicad or qmk at all before this. Thank you so much for the opportunity!

(EDIT: im so sorry my files aren't organized i couldn't figure out how to upload things under folders in time)
