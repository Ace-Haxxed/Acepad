hi guys this is nekoPad! (I know the name appears to be cchuyeePad, but that's before I came up with this name. Anyway hope yall like it
This is my first time doing this type of project so it's a pretty simple design. Also didn't realise that Alex did a 4 switch macropad until I finished this design LOL my bad 
Didn't have the time to figure out the firmware... hopefully I can still get my parts tho because this was a really fun project and I would love to see it IRL! 

BOW: 
4x Cherry MX switches
1x EC11 Encoder
1x PCB
thanks! Also not sure how shipping works.. how will Alex contact us? And paying for customs etc.

ALSO ignore the files I copied from the main hackpad... not sure how to delete it haha (first time using github)
