print request: if possible it would be great if you could print the case black

My main inspiration to do this project was that I always wanted a keyboard with a nice thocky sound, and im hoping to get that out of the gateron milky yellows :)

The hardest part of this was probably the schematic + PCB stuff with the really complex wiring and stuff with all the design rules to follow. Took me all day lol

Hopefully everything turns out well! Bye!
